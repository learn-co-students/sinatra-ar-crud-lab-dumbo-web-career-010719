<h1>Create a new article!</h1>
<form method="POST" action='/articles'>
  Title <input type="text" name="title"> <br>
  Content <input type='text' name="content"><br>
  <input type='submit' value='submit'>
</form>

Now that we have the database and model set up,
it's time to set up the ability to create an article.

First, create a route in your controller, get
'/articles/new', that renders the new.erb view.

We need to create an ERB file in the views directory,
new.erb, with a form that POSTs to a controller action,
/articles. The controller action should use the Create
CRUD action to create the article and save it to the
database. When the form on new.erb is submitted,
the action, pointing to /articles, will trigger a r
ender of an index.erb file automatically. Before we can
fully test if our form is working, we need to create
that index.erb file,
as our site will currently crash upon submission.
